Hi, Iâ€™m *@Nifrec*,
a student of Computer Science,
whose main passion is AI.
But also maths, algorithms, cognitive science, psychology and palaeontology (i.e. fossils) deeply interest me.

My favourite programming language is Python (along with its libraries Numpy and PyTorch),
but I have also programmed in Java, Ltac2 (part of the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) theorem prover, of which you probably haven't heard either ðŸ˜‰), C and JavaScript.
