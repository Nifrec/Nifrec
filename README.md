Hi, Iâ€™m *@Nifrec*,
a student of Computer Science,
whose main academic interests are AI, computer science and mathematics.
But also philosophy, biology, psychology and palaeontology (i.e. fossils) deeply interest me.

My first & main programming language is **Python** (along with its libraries Numpy and PyTorch),
I have also used:
* Java
* Ltac2 (see [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)),
* C
* JavaScript (ðŸ˜–)
* Currently in the process of learning **Haskell**, I like static typing!

Favourite tools:
* Manjaro Linux (OS)
* Vim (text editor) (With CoC for linting and autocompletion)
* LaTeX (typesetting reports and maths)
* IPE (for figures)
* VSCode (for Jupyter notebooks)
