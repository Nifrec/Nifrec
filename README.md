Hi, Iâ€™m *@Nifrec*,
a student of Computer Science,
whose main academic interests are AI, computer science and mathematics.
But also philosophy, biology, psychology and palaeontology (i.e. fossils) deeply interest me.

My first (and still main) programming language is Python (along with its libraries Numpy and PyTorch),
but I have also programmed in Java, Ltac2 (part of the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) theorem prover, 
of which you probably haven't heard either ðŸ˜‰), 
C and JavaScript (not so fond of that last one...).
Recently I have started learning Haskell as well (mostly missing static typing in Python).
